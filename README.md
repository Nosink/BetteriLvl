# BetteriLvl

Lightweight Classic Era addon that surfaces item levels where they matter: on your character, your inspect target, and in tooltips. Now faster, safer, and more accurate.

## Usage
- Open options: /betterilvl or /bilvl, or via Interface -> AddOns.
- Equip or change items to auto-refresh overlays and averages.
- Inspect a target to see their slot and average item level.

## Features
- Per-slot item level overlay.
- Average item level display.
- Quality-colored borders.
- Tooltip enhancements for item level (equipment only) and item ID.

## Compatibility
- WoW Classic Era 1.15.8.

## Commands
- /betterilvl  - open the options panel
- /bilvl       - shortcut to the same options

## Notes
- Inspect values appear after INSPECT_READY; a brief delay is normal.
- Tooltip item level shows only for equipment (Armor, Weapon, Projectile).
